### Arithmetic On Binaries
Three C files that are integrated with one another make up this C project. The goal of this programÂ is to provide basic operations on binary numbers, such as AND, OR, NOT, 1's complement, and 2's complement, and then output the result in the user's desired base. 
The routines for arithmetic complements and the main function are written in three separate C files to increase the flexibility of these files.
